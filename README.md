# Geometric Figures, Text Evaluation, and Pokémon Viewer Solutions
This repository contains solutions for three distinct programming tasks. Each solution is located in its respective directory within the repository. Below is an overview of each task and its solution.

## Task 1: Geometry Hierarchy
**Objective**: Develop a class hierarchy for geometric figures. This includes creating an abstract base class named Geometry with a method for calculating the area. From this base class, at least two specific figures (e.g., Circle, Rectangle) are derived, each implementing its area calculation.

**Solution Directory**: GeometryHierarchy
The GeometryHierarchy directory contains the implementation of the class hierarchy, including the abstract base class and the derived classes with their respective area calculation methods.

## Task 2: Text File Word Counter
**Objective**: Write a program that reads a text file, counts the number of words, and outputs the frequency of each word in descending order. The program should ignore case sensitivity.

**Solution Directory**: TextEvaluator
The TextEvaluator directory houses the solution that reads from the text file (provided in the Moodle folder of the lecture, named Kafka.txt), processes the content to count the word occurrences, and displays the results sorted by their frequency.

## Task 3: Pokémon Viewer WPF Application
**Objective**: Create a WPF application that allows searching the PokéAPI for a specific Pokémon by name. The search result should display the Pokémon's name, all abilities, type, and an image. If the Pokémon is not found, an appropriate message should be displayed. Additionally, clicking on the image should toggle between its normal and shiny variant.

**Solution Directory**: PokemonViewer
In the PokemonViewer directory, you'll find the WPF application that fulfills the task's requirements, including API integration for searching Pokémon, displaying search results with detailed information, and toggling between normal and shiny images.
